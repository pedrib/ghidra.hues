### NOTE: this project was originally created by ["quosego"][ref-self]. 
It was shared in a GitHub repository and then deleted by the author. Since the Apache License permits it, I am sharing it here as the original repo does not exist any more.
I did not write this code and do not support it for more than what I need to get it working for me. Having said that, I usually push all changes I make to this repo so it should work out of the box in the latest Ghidra versions.

The original README is below.
